A collection of functions for nonempty containers and positive numbers
Also provides support for representable ie fixed sized containers

Num1 is a safe alternative to the Num class providing lifted version of Num methods with bounds checks

Num1 provides an alternative Num class for safe arithmetic operations
which respect the bounds of the number.
There are instances for Natural / Pos / Int and Word 



There are also instances for Fin/FinMat/Mat in the cybus package


and fixed representable containers
Also provides type safe functions for use with simple lists 
Also provides a number of functions that are useful for


LRHist like Either with history of all successes and optional a failure
AsMaybe -- iterateT partitionT mapT mapT unfoldrT filterT
   accepts any failure type according to AsMaybe
     eg Nothing/Left/[] ...

safe enums for containers 
safe enum wrappers
